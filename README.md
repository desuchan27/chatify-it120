This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Open the server by
```
npm run dev
```

additional note since I forgot to include it in the clip, with the help of middleware,
-you cannot enter the dashboard page without logging in.
-at the same time, you cannot enter login page if you are already logged in, so logout first.
